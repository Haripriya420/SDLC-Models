            <p id="para">The evolutionary model is a combination of the Iterative and Incremental models of the software development life cycle. Delivering your system in a big bang release, delivering it in incremental process over time is the action done in this model. Some initial requirements and architecture envisioning need to be done. It is better for software products that have their feature sets redefined during development because of user feedback and other factors. This article focuses on discussing the Evolutionary Model in detail.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p id="para">The Evolutionary development model divides the development cycle into smaller, incremental waterfall models in which users can get access to the product at the end of each cycle.
                    <blockquote><p id="para">
                 <b style="color: brown;">>>></b>   Feedback is provided by the users on the product for the planning stage of the next cycle and the development team responds, often by changing the product, plan, or process.
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b>   Therefore, the software product evolves with time.
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b> All the models have the disadvantage that the duration of time from the start of the project to the delivery time of a solution is very high.
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b> The evolutionary model solves this problem with a different approach. 
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b>   The evolutionary model suggests breaking down work into smaller chunks, prioritizing them, and then delivering those chunks to the customer one by one.
                 <br><b  style="color: brown;">>>></b>  The number of chunks is huge and is the number of deliveries made to the customer.
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b> The main advantage is that the customer’s confidence increases as he constantly gets quantifiable goods or services from the beginning of the project to verify and validate his requirements.
                 <br><b style="color: brown;">>>></b>  The model allows for changing requirements as well as all work is broken down into maintainable work chunks. </p>

            <blockquote>
            <p id="para">The Evolutionary Model, also known as the Iterative Enhancement Model or Incremental Model, is an iterative approach to software development that evolves over time. It is a type of software development life cycle (SDLC) model that breaks down the software development process into smaller, manageable iterations. Each iteration results in the release of a partial product, and subsequent iterations enhance and build upon the previous ones. Here are the phases of the Evolutionary Model in SDLC:</p>

                         <li><b>Implementation (First Iteration) −</b>Develop a partial but functional version of the software based on the initial design.
                            This version is often referred to as the prototype or the first iteration.
                            It may not have all the desired features but serves as a starting point for further development.</li><br>
                         <li><b>Testing (First Iteration) −</b>Conduct initial testing on the prototype to identify and fix defects.
                            Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to refine requirements for subsequent iterations.</li>
